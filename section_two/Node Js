What is Node.js REPL
The Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive command-line environment 
that allows you to experiment with and execute JavaScript code on the fly. 
It provides a way to interactively write, test, and execute JavaScript code 
without the need for writing a complete script or running a separate file.
